#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of the engineering principles, methods and tools towards the development and maintanenance of software systems that are of high quality.
The importance of software engineering in the technology industry is that it enables the creation og software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as communication, entertainment, commerce and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages such as Fortran and C
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
Advent of structured programming in the 1970s
Rose of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements. This invilves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
2. Design. Involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the architecture of the software and the user interface.
3. Implementation. This is the writing of code and building of the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing. Done by conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment. This is the realeasing of the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance. This is provding ongoing suppoert, updates and enhancements to the software after deplyoment to the users or customers.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology uses a logical progression of the Software Development Life Cycle steps for a project which mimicks the direction flow of a waterfall. It sets distinct endpoints or goals for each phase of develpment which cannot be revited after their completion. This model is used in construction, manufacturing and software development. For example in construction, there are three general steps:
1. A building's physical design is created before any construction begins.
2. The foundation is poured before the skeleton of a building is erected.
3. The skeletom of the building is completed before the wall are built.
Agile methodology is an approach that centers around incremental and iterative steps to completing projects where the incremental parts of the project are carried out in short-term development cycles. Agile prioritizes quick delivery, adapting to change and collaboration rather than top-down management and following a set plan. There is also continous feedback that allows team members to adjust to challenges as they arise and stakeholders have the opportunity to communicate consistently.
- Agile methodology is a good fit for projects that need to be flexible and change alot like making computer programs while Waterfall is just right for porjects that have clear steps and simple , straight-ahead plans, like following a recipe.
- Waterfall has a fixed timeline in that the start and finish of the project are already mapped out from the beginning while Agile has a flexible timeline that adapts as the project progresses.
- In Waterfall, once the end goal is established, the client is involved apart from specific checkins or deliverables while in Agile, involving clients in the development of the project is a crucial step.
- In Waterfall, each phase needs to be fully completed before proceeding to the next one, while in Agile, the project adapts the different directions that the different stages may take.
- The budget in Waterfall methodology is fixed because the project is determined from start to finish while in Agile, the budget is felxible as Agile is encourages experimentations and welcomes changes in different directions in the later stages of the project.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for:
1. Designing and creating software by follwing a systematic software development life cycle approach to deliver products to meet the client's needs.
2. Adjusting and upgrading the current applications.
3. Perform quality checks and tests for applications so as to ensure the software is working as it is supposed to.
4. Make recors of operations for future use as this helps when an old project needs to be revisited.
Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for:
1. Idenitifying and reporting issues that may arise furing the design and planning phases.
2. Creating detailed, comprehensive and well-structured plans and test cases.
3. Planning and coordinating quality testing activities.
Project Manager is responsible for:
1. Planning everything from execution to delivery of the project
2. Oversees the software development team and ensuring that the members of the team perform their tasks.
3. Delgate workload to the members of the team.
4. Monitoring Progress and Tracking Roadblocks.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments(IDEs) facilitate the creation of other software application by providing a space to write, complie and debug code. Examples of IDEs software include Microsoft Visual Studio and NetBeans.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them redice development time and increase successful deployments.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Change of requirements by the client during the developpment cycle which resutls in the scraping of the project of delays. To overcome this, there needs to be clear communication between the client and the engineering about what it is the client's expectations are.
Technical debt which accured from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, it impedes future development efforts and inceases maintenance costs. To overcome this, a flexible budget needs to be set that can adapt to the changes of that may occur during the project development.
Tight deadlines that put alot of pressure on the engineers to produce results that end up being rushed in development resulting in compromised quality. To overcome this, a suitable timetable should be developed by the engineers and the client, one that will allow the engineers to work without pressure and allow enough time for quality work to be produced.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the testing of individual components and modules of the software. This is importance as it addresses small issues that may prevent the running of the software and enables them to be fixed at an earlier stage.
Integration testing is the testing of the interactions between different components and subsytems of the software. This is important as it allows the engineers to know what bugs to fix to the bugs to streamline the interaction.
System testing is the testing of the entire software system as a whole. This is important as it allows the engineers to see whether the components of the software works together.
Acceptance testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. This is essential as it allows the engineers to curate the software based on the needs of the users from the feedback acquired from the users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions and statements that allows one to get the best possible repsonses from Artificial Intelligence Models as this helps to avoids asking vague questions and getting confusing answers by making one's questions clear and specific so that the AI understands exactly what you want.
The importance of interacting with AI models allows the AI models to adapt and improve on their feedback.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt -  Tell me about perfumes.
Improved prompt -  Tell me about the process of making perfurmes.
The improved prompt is more effectuve as it allows one to get a more focused response instead of a vague one.
